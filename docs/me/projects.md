## MTG life counter

[Here!](https://hervit0.github.io/life)

My main passion at the moment is [Magic The Gathering](https://magic.wizards.com/en), an amazing card game.

During that multiplayer game, the life points of the different players have to be tracked, so I created a life counter with multiple useful features.

Made with Vue 3, full client-side software.

It is still a WIP project, especially for the artistic direction...

## Argeebeedle

A wordle-based game about RGB colours.

Made with Vue 3, full client-side game.

Funnily enough, I have never beaten my game.

For my wedding, I built a photo booth mobile/browser friendly webapp.

Made with love with Vue 3, TypeScript, Golang, AWS, CDK.

Proud to say that there was no error and amazing latencies on the day!
