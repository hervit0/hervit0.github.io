## The switch between chemical engineering and software engineering

I got graduated with an Msc in chemical engineering in 2013, from there I worked in Paris for 3 years as a chemical engineer. I slowly realised that it was for me and decided to switch to software engineering. I arrived in the UK in 2016, got my first job as software engineer in London, never left the UK since, it was the best decision I could have made.

I wrote an [article] about it.
