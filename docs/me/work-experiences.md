- Led and designed numerous internal and client-facing web apps and APIs; worked on the company‚Äôs two major web apps and over 50 microservices, always keeping security, scalability, and resilience in mind. The only outages in seven years were due to third-party services. Some greenfield projects I worked on from inception helped to seal multi-million-pound contracts with the biggest banks in the UK.
- Successfully transformed a legacy product (10 microservices) written in Scala into a modern, high-standard Golang application while it was actively used by customers. The migration was invisible to users, with no outages or downtime.
- Collaborated closely with the Product and Design teams to ensure continuous value delivery to customers. Participated in numerous customer-facing discovery and feedback sessions to understand their needs directly.
- Mentored many junior and mid-level engineers, most of whom successfully reached senior level.
- Maintained a strong presence at conferences (mainly AWS and Golang), sharing knowledge and experience while staying up-to-date on technologies, frameworks, and techniques. Also delivered a successful talk on microservices at Conf42.
- Contributed to ISO audit readiness and served on the CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team). The company has never failed to retain all its ISO and security certifications.
