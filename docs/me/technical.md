# Technical background

I am a senior software engineer with 10 years of experience. I love learning new languages and frameworks.

I equally enjoy working on server-side, front-end, infrastructure, security, etc. I find software engineering and
computer science to be a never-ending source of curiosity and intellectual fulfillment.

A strong advocate of clean code, TDD, and automation.
