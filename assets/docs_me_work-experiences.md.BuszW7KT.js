The only outages in seven years were due to third-party services. Some greenfield projects I worked on from inception helped to seal multi-million-pound contracts with the biggest banks in the UK.</li><li>Successfully transformed a legacy product (10 microservices) written in Scala into a modern, high-standard Golang application while it was actively used by customers. The migration was invisible to users, with no outages or downtime.</li><li>Collaborated closely with the Product and Design teams to ensure continuous value delivery to customers. Participated in numerous customer-facing discovery and feedback sessions to understand their needs directly.</li><li>Mentored many junior and mid-level engineers, most of whom successfully reached senior level.</li><li>Maintained a strong presence at conferences (mainly AWS and Golang), sharing knowledge and experience while staying up-to-date on technologies, frameworks, and techniques. Also delivered a successful talk on microservices at Conf42.</li><li>Contributed to ISO audit readiness and served on the CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team).
