<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Herve has grown his knowledge and experience in a few different areas over the course of the year including front-end expertise with the likes of Angular and introducing new libraries for testing and ensure the quality of our web application. In addition, he has been growing his understanding and supporting a new initiative to research and champion the best coding assistants to leverage within the engineering department, providing feedback to me and presenting use case demonstration to the </span></span>
<span class="line"><span>wider teams. He is also continuing to expand his mentoring skills by advising new junior team members and helping train [REDACTED] engineer on the [REDACTED] code base.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>2. What was this person’s impact on the team, department and organisational goals over the last year?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Herve has contributed a great deal across a wide range of deliverable including notifications, permissions, [REDACTED] requests, data analytics, general fixes, technical process improvements, all of which have contributed to acquiring or retaining customers!</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>3. What blockers or challenges did this person experience over the last year, that impacted their ability to achieve goals or meet expectations?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>It&#39;s been a turbulent time for the company over the past year and that has led to disruption in line management and product management for Herve and the team. I appreciate this had had a negative affect on morale and created some confusion and anxiety for people. We&#39;ll be prioritising stability as best we can moving into the new financial year, and I am finalising a plan to address the lack of formal management in the department soon which will hopefully provide better support for individuals through times of change.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>I&#39;ve noted the feedback from you regarding noise in the office and will pass this along.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>4. What are 2-3 skills or competencies you&#39;d like them to focus on for further development?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>As an engineer Herve will need to continue to learn the [REDACTED] code base and services. It would be great to work with Herve to try to find a way to combine the technical approaches from [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] into a single harmonious way of working now as team [REDACTED]. This will take some time but no doubt will be beneficial in the long run.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Our technology strategy continues to centre on [REDACTED], so continuing to expand knowledge of their products and services and how we could leverage them at the company would be useful.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Finally, we want to improve our usage of AI tools (where relevant) within the department and across the company. It would be great to have Herve leading the charge on this in the coming year.</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>1. How has this person progressed over the last year?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Herve has become an integral part of the [REDACTED] team, consistently making valuable contributions to our product deliverables and technical advancements. He is a fast learner, quickly acquiring front-end development skills, and is now highly proficient in this area. One of Herve&#39;s standout qualities is his innovative mindset, which drives him to think creatively about ways to enhance our product&#39;s technical aspects. I&#39;d like to take this opportunity to thank Herve for his incredible effort on the Analytic [REDACTED] task. It was a late request from the Analytics team and turned out to be more complex than anticipated. Herve went above and beyond to ensure its successful delivery. Thank you so much, Herve.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>2. What was this person’s impact on the team, department and organisational goals over the last year?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Herve demonstrates strong communication and teamwork skills. He is always willing to share his knowledge and new insights with the rest of the team. He regularly offers constructive feedback to his teammates, helping them to continuously improve. It&#39;s great to see his collaboration with Team [REDACTED] on the new Testing Framework project.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>3. What blockers or challenges did this person experience over the last year that impacted their ability to achieve goals or meet expectations?</span></span>

<span class="line"><span>4. What are 2-3 skills or competencies you&#39;d like them to focus on for further development?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Given his comfort with [REDACTED]&#39;s services, the next logical step for Herve is to begin taking the lead on larger projects in the coming year.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>5. Please provide any additional information that you would like to include in this evaluation that wasn&#39;t captured in the above form.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Herve is making a significant impact on [REDACTED]&#39;s product deliverables and technical improvements. He is undeniably innovative, consistently bringing new ideas to the table. As a technically skilled senior engineer, Herve has integrated well into [REDACTED] Tesla. I agree with the Principal Engineer&#39;s feedback that Herve&#39;s next step should be to lead larger product delivery projects, allowing him to further leverage his knowledge and experience within Tesla. I want to thank Herve for his hard work this year and wish him continued success in the year ahead.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>6. How did this person display the company values in their role?</span></span>
<span class="line"><span></span></span>
<span class="line"><span>Herve consistently embodies all the [REDACTED] values in his day-to-day work. His supportive and considerate nature is evident in how he has taken the team&#39;s feedback on board regarding code commits to staging. I also appreciate Herve&#39;s collaboration with both the team and the Analytics group in delivering the Analytics [REDACTED] task, and I agree with his comments on the importance of this teamwork.</span></span></code></pre></div>`,7)]))}const u=a(i,[["render",o]]);export{m as __pageData,u as default};
